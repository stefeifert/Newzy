Newzy

An app that allows the user to search and view top trending news articles quickly from a variety of news sources. Newzy allows users to easily search through specific news agencies or via keywords of their choosing. Users also have the ability to customize their search results by adding specifc news source buttons which will display top trending articles of that publication specifically. Since articles results are based on their level of trending, the news results are updated every 15 minutes. This is why users then have the ability to save articles, allowing them to view it another time, save it in order to share it, or just simply read it later.

The user can log in with a username and password to create an account which then allows them access to the application and it's features.

The site was created using React for the front-end, Node and Express for the runtime environment/routing, Passport for the middleware user authentication, MongoDB as the database, and finally an external api source from which we pulled information: [News API](https://newsapi.org/)

This was created using a fullstack MERN approach.
